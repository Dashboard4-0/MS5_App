### Technical Achievements

#### Database Architecture
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL 15 with TimescaleDB extension
- **Read Replicas**: 2 replicas for performance optimization
- **Storage**: Azure Premium SSD with 100GB primary, 50GB replicas
- **Clustering**: Anti-affinity rules for high availability
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards

#### TimescaleDB Features
- **Hypertables**: metric_hist, oee_calculations
- **Continuous Aggregates**: oee_hourly_aggregate, metric_hourly_aggregate
- **Compression**: 7-day policy for telemetry, 30-day for metrics
- **Retention**: 90 days for telemetry, 1 year for metrics
- **Performance**: Optimized chunk intervals and indexes

#### Security Implementation
- **Network Policies**: Database isolation and access control
- **SSL/TLS**: Encrypted connections for all database access
- **Authentication**: SCRAM-SHA-256 password encryption
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for compliance
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with least privilege

#### Monitoring and Observability
- **SLI/SLO**: Service level indicators and objectives defined
- **Performance Metrics**: Query latency, connection pool utilization
- **Cost Monitoring**: Resource usage and optimization tracking
- **Compliance Monitoring**: GDPR, SOC2, FDA 21 CFR Part 11
- **Alerting**: Comprehensive alerting for all critical metrics

### Performance Metrics
