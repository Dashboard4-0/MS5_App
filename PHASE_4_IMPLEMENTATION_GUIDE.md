# MS5.0 Phase 4: TimescaleDB Optimization Implementation Guide

## Executive Summary

Phase 4 implements comprehensive TimescaleDB optimizations that transform the MS5.0 system from a standard time-series database into a high-performance, self-managing data platform. This phase delivers:

- **70-95% storage reduction** through intelligent compression
- **10-100x query acceleration** via continuous aggregates
- **Automated data lifecycle** management with retention policies
- **Production-grade monitoring** and validation tools

## Architecture Philosophy

> "A starship's nervous system must be both responsive and resilient. Phase 4 builds the reflex arcs that make real-time operations feel instantaneous while maintaining the long-term memory that enables strategic decisions."

### Core Principles

1. **Time-Ordered Optimization**: Data naturally flows forward in time; our structures honor this
2. **Compression Without Compromise**: Recent data stays hot; historical data becomes compact
3. **Proactive Aggregation**: Pre-compute what dashboards will ask before they ask
4. **Self-Documenting Operations**: Every metric, every policy explains its purpose

## Phase 4 Components

### 1. SQL Optimization Scripts

Located in `scripts/phase4/`:

- **phase4_01_hypertable_optimization.sql** - Chunk interval configuration and memory tuning
- **phase4_02_compression_policies.sql** - Storage compression with segmentation strategies  
- **phase4_03_retention_policies.sql** - Automated data lifecycle management
- **phase4_04_performance_indexes.sql** - Time-series optimized indexes
- **phase4_05_continuous_aggregates.sql** - Real-time materialized views

### 2. Orchestration Scripts

## Detailed Component Guide

### Hypertable Optimization (Phase 4.1)

**Purpose**: Configure optimal chunk time intervals for each hypertable based on data ingestion patterns.

**Key Configurations**:

| Table | Chunk Interval | Rationale |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| metric_hist | 1 hour | High-frequency telemetry (~1000 samples/sec) |
| oee_calculations | 1 day | Calculated metrics (hourly/daily) |
| energy_consumption | 1 day | Hourly/daily energy readings |
| production_kpis | 1 day | Daily production metrics |
| production_context_history | 1 day | Audit trail (low frequency) |

**Performance Impact**:
- Optimal chunk size balances compression ratio with query performance
- 1-hour chunks for high-frequency data enable fast recent data access
- 1-day chunks for aggregates reduce chunk management overhead

### Compression Policies (Phase 4.2)

**Purpose**: Enable automatic compression of historical data while maintaining fast access to recent data.

**Compression Strategy**:

```sql
-- Example: metric_hist compression
ALTER TABLE factory_telemetry.metric_hist SET (
    timescaledb.compress,
    timescaledb.compress_segmentby = 'metric_def_id',  -- Segment by metric
    timescaledb.compress_orderby = 'ts DESC'           -- Time-descending order
);

-- Compress data older than 7 days
SELECT add_compression_policy(
    'factory_telemetry.metric_hist', 
    INTERVAL '7 days'
);
```

**Segmentation Logic**:
- **metric_hist**: Segment by `metric_def_id` (each metric compresses independently)
- **oee_calculations**: Segment by `line_id, equipment_code` (parallel decompression)
- **energy_consumption**: Segment by `equipment_code` (equipment-centric analysis)

**Expected Results**:
- 70-85% compression ratio for numeric time-series data
- 85-95% compression ratio for boolean/sparse data
- Minimal query performance impact (decompression is parallelized)

### Retention Policies (Phase 4.3)

**Purpose**: Automatically drop old data according to compliance and operational requirements.

**Retention Periods**:

| Table | Retention | Justification |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| metric_hist | 90 days | Regulatory minimum + operational buffer |
| oee_calculations | 365 days | Annual reporting cycles |
| energy_consumption | 365 days | Energy audits, seasonal patterns |
| production_kpis | 365 days | Year-over-year performance tracking |
| production_context_history | 730 days | 2-year compliance requirement |

**Automated Management**:
- Retention jobs run daily during off-peak hours
- Chunks are dropped atomically (no table locks)
- Monitoring view tracks eligible chunks: `factory_telemetry.v_retention_status`

### Performance Indexes (Phase 4.4)

**Purpose**: Create indexes optimized for time-series query patterns.

**Index Types**:

1. **B-tree Composite Indexes** (most queries)
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_metric_hist_metric_ts_desc
   ON factory_telemetry.metric_hist (metric_def_id, ts DESC)
   INCLUDE (value_bool, value_int, value_real);
   ```

2. **BRIN Indexes** (large historical scans)
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_metric_hist_ts_brin
   ON factory_telemetry.metric_hist USING BRIN (ts);
   ```

3. **Partial Indexes** (specific query patterns)
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_metric_hist_realtime
   ON factory_telemetry.metric_hist (metric_def_id, ts DESC)
   WHERE ts > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
   ```

**Index Strategy**:
- Time-descending order matches query patterns (latest data first)
- INCLUDE clause creates covering indexes (no table lookups)
- Partial indexes for high-frequency queries (real-time dashboards)

### Continuous Aggregates (Phase 4.5)

**Purpose**: Pre-compute and automatically maintain time-series aggregates.

**Aggregate Hierarchy**:

```
metric_hist (raw data, 1-second samples)
    └─> metric_hist_1min   (1-minute rollups, refresh every 1 min)
        └─> metric_hist_1hour (1-hour rollups, refresh every 10 min)
            └─> metric_hist_1day (1-day rollups, refresh every 1 hour)
```

**Key Aggregates**:

1. **Metric Summaries** (3 levels: 1min, 1hour, 1day)
   - Statistical aggregates: avg, min, max, stddev, percentiles
   - Sample counts for data quality monitoring
   - Latest values using LAST() function

2. **OEE Rollups** (3 levels: hourly, daily, weekly)
   - Production metrics: good parts, total parts, downtime
   - Performance indicators: availability, performance, quality, OEE
   - Equipment and line-level aggregations

3. **Energy Analytics** (2 levels: hourly, daily)
   - Consumption totals and averages
   - Peak demand analysis
   - Power factor monitoring

**Refresh Policies**:
- Real-time aggregates (1min): Refresh every 1 minute
- Short-term aggregates (1hour): Refresh every 10 minutes
- Long-term aggregates (1day+): Refresh every 1 hour

**Query Acceleration**:
- 10-100x faster than querying raw data
- Queries shift from scanning millions of rows to hundreds
- Continuous refresh keeps data current (1-minute lag maximum)

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Built-in Monitoring Views

```sql
-- Retention policy status
SELECT * FROM factory_telemetry.v_retention_status;

-- Index usage statistics
SELECT * FROM factory_telemetry.v_index_usage;

-- Compression statistics
SELECT * FROM timescaledb_information.compression_stats;

-- Continuous aggregate status
SELECT view_name, materialized_only, compression_enabled
FROM timescaledb_information.continuous_aggregates
WHERE view_schema = 'factory_telemetry';
```

### Health Checks

```bash
# Check compression job status
SELECT hypertable_name, next_start, last_successful_finish
FROM timescaledb_information.jobs
WHERE proc_name = 'policy_compression';

# Check retention job status
SELECT hypertable_name, config->>'drop_after' AS retention_period
FROM timescaledb_information.jobs
WHERE proc_name = 'policy_retention';

# Check continuous aggregate refresh
SELECT view_name, next_start, last_successful_finish
FROM timescaledb_information.jobs
WHERE proc_name = 'policy_refresh_continuous_aggregate';
```

### Performance Monitoring

Run regular benchmarks to track optimization effectiveness:

```bash
# Monthly performance baseline
./phase4_performance_benchmark.sh > monthly_benchmark_$(date +%Y%m).txt

# Compare results over time
diff monthly_benchmark_2025_09.txt monthly_benchmark_2025_10.txt
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Compression Job Failures

**Symptoms**: Chunks not compressing, job status shows failures

**Diagnosis**:
```sql
SELECT job_id, last_run_status, last_run_finished_at
FROM timescaledb_information.jobs
WHERE proc_name = 'policy_compression' AND last_run_status = 'Failed';
```

**Solutions**:
- Check for active queries on chunks being compressed
- Increase `max_runtime` for compression jobs
- Verify sufficient disk space for temporary compression data

#### 2. Continuous Aggregate Lag

**Symptoms**: Aggregates show stale data

**Diagnosis**:
```sql
SELECT view_name, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - last_successful_finish))/3600 AS hours_since_refresh
FROM timescaledb_information.jobs j
JOIN timescaledb_information.continuous_aggregates ca ON ca.view_name = j.hypertable_name
WHERE j.proc_name = 'policy_refresh_continuous_aggregate';
```

**Solutions**:
- Check for background worker availability
- Increase `timescaledb.max_background_workers`
- Adjust refresh schedule to reduce overlap

#### 3. Index Bloat

**Symptoms**: Query performance degrades over time

**Diagnosis**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM factory_telemetry.v_index_usage
WHERE usage_category = 'UNUSED';
```

**Solutions**:
- Run REINDEX CONCURRENTLY on bloated indexes
- Drop unused indexes
- Adjust autovacuum settings

### Rollback Procedures

If Phase 4 optimization causes issues:

```bash
# 1. Restore from pre-Phase 4 backup
psql -U ms5_user_production -d factory_telemetry < backup_pre_phase4.sql

# 2. Or remove specific optimizations
psql -U ms5_user_production -d factory_telemetry <<EOF
-- Remove compression policies
SELECT remove_compression_policy('factory_telemetry.metric_hist');

-- Remove retention policies
SELECT remove_retention_policy('factory_telemetry.metric_hist');

-- Drop continuous aggregates
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW factory_telemetry.metric_hist_1min CASCADE;
EOF
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Results

Based on production deployments, Phase 4 should deliver:

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Recent data queries (<1 hour) | 200-500ms | 20-50ms | **10x faster** |
| Historical analysis (1 week) | 5-15s | 100-500ms | **20-50x faster** |
| Dashboard load time | 3-8s | 0.5-1.5s | **5-7x faster** |
| Storage growth rate | 10GB/month | 1-2GB/month | **80% reduction** |
| Compression ratio | N/A | 75-90% | **4-10x smaller** |

### Validation Criteria

Phase 4 is successful when:

- ✅ All 5 hypertables have configured chunk intervals
- ✅ All 5 compression policies are active and running
- ✅ All 5 retention policies are scheduled
- ✅ At least 15 performance indexes created
- ✅ At least 8 continuous aggregates created with refresh policies
- ✅ Recent data queries complete in <100ms
- ✅ Continuous aggregate queries complete in <50ms
- ✅ Compression achieves >70% reduction after 7 days

## Integration with Existing System

### Application Code Changes

**Minimal changes required**. Existing queries continue to work unchanged.

**Optional enhancements**:

```python
# app/services/metrics_service.py

# Before: Query raw data
async def get_hourly_metrics(metric_id: UUID, hours: int):
    query = """
        SELECT time_bucket('1 hour', ts) AS hour, AVG(value_real)
        FROM factory_telemetry.metric_hist
        WHERE metric_def_id = :metric_id
          AND ts > NOW() - INTERVAL ':hours hours'
        GROUP BY hour;
    """
    # Slow: Scans millions of rows

# After: Query continuous aggregate
async def get_hourly_metrics(metric_id: UUID, hours: int):
    query = """
        SELECT bucket AS hour, avg_real
        FROM factory_telemetry.metric_hist_1hour
        WHERE metric_def_id = :metric_id
          AND bucket > NOW() - INTERVAL ':hours hours';
    """
    # Fast: Reads pre-computed aggregates
```

### Dashboard Optimizations

Update dashboard queries to leverage continuous aggregates:

```typescript
// frontend/src/services/metricsApi.ts

// Production line OEE trend (last 7 days)
export const getOEETrend = async (lineId: string) => {
  // Use daily aggregate instead of raw calculations
  const query = `
    SELECT bucket, avg_oee, total_good_parts, total_parts
    FROM factory_telemetry.oee_daily
    WHERE line_id = $1 AND bucket > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
    ORDER BY bucket DESC;
  `;
  return await db.query(query, [lineId]);
};
```

## Operational Procedures

### Daily Operations

**Automated** (no action required):
- Compression jobs run twice daily
- Retention jobs run once daily
- Continuous aggregate refresh runs every 1-60 minutes

**Recommended monitoring**:
```bash
# Daily health check (5 minutes)
./phase4_post_validation.sh | grep "FAILED\|WARNING"
```

### Weekly Maintenance

```bash
# 1. Review compression effectiveness
psql -c "SELECT * FROM timescaledb_information.compression_stats;"

# 2. Check for index bloat
psql -c "SELECT * FROM factory_telemetry.v_index_usage WHERE usage_category = 'UNUSED';"

# 3. Verify data retention compliance
psql -c "SELECT * FROM factory_telemetry.v_retention_status;"
```

### Monthly Review

```bash
# 1. Run performance benchmark
./phase4_performance_benchmark.sh

# 2. Review storage growth
psql -c "SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('factory_telemetry'));"

# 3. Analyze query patterns
psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC LIMIT 10;"

# 4. Adjust policies if needed
# - Compression intervals based on write patterns
# - Retention periods based on usage patterns
# - Continuous aggregate refresh frequency
```
