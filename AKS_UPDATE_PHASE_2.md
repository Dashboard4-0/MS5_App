## Conclusion

Phase 2 has been successfully completed, providing a comprehensive foundation for the MS5.0 Floor Dashboard on AKS. The Kubernetes manifests ensure proper resource management, security, and scalability. The monitoring and observability components provide the necessary visibility into the system's health and performance.

The next phase will build upon this foundation to migrate the actual data and services, ensuring a smooth transition to the AKS environment.
