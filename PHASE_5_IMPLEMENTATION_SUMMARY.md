## Architecture Highlights

### Design Patterns Used
1. **Dependency Injection** - FastAPI dependencies for clean code
2. **Async/Await** - Non-blocking operations throughout
3. **Context Managers** - Proper resource cleanup
4. **Graceful Degradation** - App starts even if policies fail
5. **Single Responsibility** - Each function has one clear purpose

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### 1. Non-Blocking Policy Setup
**Why**: Allow application to start even if TimescaleDB temporarily unavailable  
**Benefit**: Higher availability, manual recovery possible

#### 2. Table-Specific Optimization
**Why**: Different tables have different query patterns  
**Benefit**: Optimal performance per table type

#### 3. Comprehensive Monitoring
**Why**: Production systems need full observability  
**Benefit**: Quick troubleshooting, proactive issue detection

#### 4. Permission-Based Access
**Why**: Sensitive metrics should be protected  
**Benefit**: Security compliance, audit trail

2. Chunk reordering not implemented (rarely needed)
3. Custom retention policies per metric (uses table-level)

### Future Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Time-bucket optimization recommendations
   - Automatic chunk interval tuning
   - Predictive storage forecasting

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Real-time compression job tracking
   - Historical performance trends
   - Anomaly detection

3. **Management Tools**
   - Manual chunk management endpoints
   - Policy testing/simulation
   - Data export tools

**Note**: All limitations are intentional scope boundaries, not defects.
