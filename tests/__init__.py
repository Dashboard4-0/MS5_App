"""
MS5.0 Floor Dashboard - Testing Infrastructure

The nervous system of a starship requires flawless testing architecture.
Every component must be tested with the precision of cosmic navigation.

This module provides the foundation for comprehensive testing across:
- Unit tests for all services and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints  
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Performance tests for load scenarios

Architecture Principles:
- Every test is deterministic and isolated
- Test data is managed with surgical precision
- Coverage targets are enforced programmatically
- Performance benchmarks are cosmic-scale reliable
