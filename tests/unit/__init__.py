"""
MS5.0 Floor Dashboard - Unit Tests

Unit tests for all backend services and utilities.
Each test is isolated, deterministic, and tests a single unit of functionality.

Architecture:
- Tests are organized by service/module
- Each test file covers one service completely
- Mock dependencies to ensure isolation
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
