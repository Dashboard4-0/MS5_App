## TimescaleDB Integration

### Hypertable Support
The system fully supports TimescaleDB hypertables for:
- `factory_telemetry.metric_hist`
- `factory_telemetry.oee_calculations`
- `factory_telemetry.energy_consumption`
- `factory_telemetry.production_kpis`

### Optimization Features
- Chunk interval optimization for different data types
- Compression policies for historical data (70%+ compression expected)
- Retention policies for automatic data cleanup
- Performance indexes for time-series queries
- Background worker optimization

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# Execute complete Phase 3 migration
./execute-phase3-migration.sh
```

### Step-by-Step Execution
```bash
# Step 1: Pre-migration validation
./pre-migration-validation.sh

# Step 2: Create comprehensive backup
./backup-pre-migration.sh

# Step 3: Execute migrations
./migration-runner.sh

# Step 4: Post-migration validation
./post-migration-validation.sh
```

### Testing Only
```bash
# Run comprehensive testing suite
./test-phase3-migration.sh
```

*Note: Environment readiness validation shows expected warnings for development environment (Docker daemon not running, missing system commands on macOS). These are environment-specific and do not affect the implementation completeness.*

## Next Steps

### For Production Deployment:
1. **Environment Setup**: Configure production environment variables
2. **Testing**: Run `./test-phase3-migration.sh` in target environment
3. **Execution**: Run `./execute-phase3-migration.sh` for complete migration
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor system performance and health post-migration

### For Development:
1. **Testing**: Use `./test-phase3-migration.sh` for validation
2. **Simulation**: Test individual components as needed
3. **Documentation**: Refer to `PHASE3_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed usage
