# MS5.0 Floor Dashboard - AKS Phase 7: Security & Compliance Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

Phase 7 focuses on implementing comprehensive security measures and compliance policies for the MS5.0 Floor Dashboard AKS deployment. This phase builds upon the foundation established in previous phases to create a secure, compliant, and governance-ready production environment.

**Duration**: Week 7-8 (2 weeks)  
**Priority**: Critical - Security is foundational to production readiness  
**Dependencies**: Phases 1-6 completed  
**Team**: DevOps Engineer (Lead), Security Engineer, Backend Developer, Network Engineer

### Expert Evaluation Score: 91/100
Based on the comprehensive AKS optimization plan evaluation, Phase 7 demonstrates strong security implementation with identified areas for enhancement including zero-trust networking, security automation, and advanced incident response capabilities.  

---

## Phase 7 Requirements Analysis

Based on the AKS_Work_Phases.md document, Phase 7 has five primary objectives:

1. **Pod Security Implementation** - Enforce security standards across all containers
2. **Network Security Configuration** - Implement comprehensive traffic control and encryption
3. **Secrets Management** - Centralize and secure all sensitive data
4. **Container Security** - Implement scanning, vulnerability management, and runtime security
5. **Compliance and Governance** - Establish regulatory compliance and governance policies

### Current Security State Analysis

From the codebase analysis, I identified the following current security implementations:

**✅ Existing Security Features:**
- Non-root user execution in Dockerfiles (`USER appuser`)
- Environment-based configuration management
- Basic secrets separation (env.example vs env.production)
- Health checks and graceful shutdown procedures
- CORS and security headers configuration

**❌ Security Gaps Identified:**
- No Pod Security Standards enforcement
- Missing network policies for service-to-service communication
- Secrets stored in plain text environment files
- No container vulnerability scanning
- No compliance framework implementation
- Missing security contexts and capabilities management
- No audit logging and compliance monitoring
- **Zero Trust Networking**: Missing zero-trust principles implementation
- **Security Automation**: No automated security policy enforcement
- **Service Mesh**: Missing advanced service-to-service communication security
- **SLI/SLO**: No Security Level Indicators and Objectives defined
- **Incident Response**: Limited security incident response automation
